# About

Hello, I'm Marius! Currently studying for my MSc in Informatics at the
University of Oslo. I have a strong passion for programming and technology, and
I enjoy exploring both the new and old.

In my spare time, I spend an unhealthy amount of time constantly tweaking my
[system](#). Outside of that, I thorougly enjoy reading, especially fantasy and
related genres. Recently I also started dipping my toes into D&D.

## Currently working on

My thesis.

## Tools

**Vim**: or NeoVim depending on, was my primary editor for years. I still use
it when in the terminal.

**Emacs**: My primary editor.

**Fish**: The shell I use for interactive use, previously zsh but that is slow
as dirt. I do my scripting in bash or clojure.

**Foot**: Fast and simple terminal emulator.

**NixOS**: Power of declarative. I love everything about this, except how
flakes are still experimental.

**Hyprland**: Been on Wayland for a while (years) now. As far as compositors
go, this one has all the features I could want. River is my 2nd choice and is
also brilliant.
