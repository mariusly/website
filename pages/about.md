# About

Hello, I'm Marius! Currently studying for my MSc in Informatics at the University of Oslo. I have a strong passion for programming and technology, and I enjoy exploring both the new and old.

In my spare time, I spend an unhealthy amount of time constantly tweaking my [system](#). Outside of that, I thorougly enjoy reading, especially fantasy and related genres. Recently I also started dipping my toes into D&D.

## Currently working on

My thesis.

## Tools

**Vim**: .. or NeoVim depending on, was my primary editor for years. I still use it when in the terminal.

**Emacs**: My primary editor, I keep Zed (with FHS support) as backup in case I need some extension.

**Fish**: The shell I use for interactive use, previously zsh but that is slow as dirt. I still do my scripting in bash. No fancy prompt for me though. All I need is git status and cwd.

**Ghostty**: Literally just a terminal emulator. Same old same old, but following system theme shouldn't be so hard.

**NixOS**: Power of declarative. I love everything about this, except how flakes are still experimental.

**River**: Been on Wayland for a while now. It works great. River is my compositor of choice. I don't rice.
